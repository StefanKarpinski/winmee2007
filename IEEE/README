This IEEEtran.cls is the official LaTeX class for authors of the
Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) transactions
journals and conferences. In addition to being carried on IEEE's site,
IEEEtran.cls may be found at:

http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/IEEEtran/

The CTAN site may have additional files related to non-IEEE uses of this
tool.

The most recent version of IEEEtran.cls is version 1.6c.
This is an interim bug fix release that corrects the compatibility
issue with preview-LaTeX and subfigure.sty.

Version 1.7 is expected to be released later this month.


Best wishes for all your publication endeavors,
